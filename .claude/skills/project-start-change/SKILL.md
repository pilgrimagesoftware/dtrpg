description: Begin implementation work on an OpenSpec change - asks for the change name, locates its linked GitHub Issue (or finds one by matching the change name), sets up an isolated git worktree, and preps the issue/branch/PR for active work. Use when the user wants to start, pick up, or resume coding on an OpenSpec change - not for writing the proposal itself or for implementing tasks once the worktree already exists (use openspec-apply-change for that).
---

Set up everything needed to start coding on an OpenSpec change: the linked GitHub Issue, an
isolated git worktree, and a branch ready for `openspec-apply-change` to take over.

## Steps

### 1. Get the change name

Ask the user which change to start, unless one is already clear from conversation context.
If unsure, offer to run `openspec list --json` in candidate repos to show options.

### 2. Locate the change

OpenSpec changes live in the umbrella `dtrpg` repo or in a submodule (`dtrpg-app`,
`dtrpg-api`, `dtrpg-sdk/rust`, `dtrpg-sdk/swift`, or their nested repos - see
`docs/openspec.md`). Search `openspec/changes/<name>` across the umbrella and submodules to
find which repo owns it. If it exists in more than one place, ask the user to disambiguate.

Read that change's `proposal.md` (and `design.md` if present) for context on scope and
affected files.

### 3. Find the linked GitHub Issue

- Check `proposal.md`/`design.md`/`tasks.md` for an existing issue reference (`#123` or a
  full issue URL).
- If none is found, search the change's repo for an issue whose title or body names the
  change: `gh issue list --repo <owner/repo> --state all --search "<change-name> in:title,body" --json number,title,url,state`
- If zero or multiple candidates come back, show them to the user (AskUserQuestion) rather
  than guessing. If truly none exists, tell the user and stop - do not create one yourself;
  that is a separate, explicit action (see `docs/openspec.md`'s GitHub Issues section or the
  `to-issues` skill).

### 4. Prep the issue for active work

Per `docs/openspec.md` ("When starting on a change"):

- `gh issue edit <n> --repo <owner/repo> --add-assignee @me`
- Record a start date on the issue if the project uses that convention (check existing
  issues for the field before assuming one exists).
- Move the issue's project status to "In Progress" (`gh project item-edit`, or ask the user
  for the project/field IDs if you don't already know them).

### 5. Create the worktree

Follow the project's fixed worktree convention (do not use `EnterWorktree` - it creates
worktrees under `.claude/worktrees/`, which conflicts with this project's required path):

```
git worktree add /Users/paulyhedral/Projects/Code/Libri/dtrpg/worktrees/<repo-slug>-<branch-slug> -b <branch-name> origin/develop
```

- `<repo-slug>`: the repo path with `/` replaced by `-` (e.g. `dtrpg-sdk-rust`).
- `<branch-name>`: `<issue-number>-<change-name>`, matching GitHub's own suggested linked
  branch name so the branch auto-links to the issue.
- Base ref is `origin/develop` for code repos, `origin/master` for meta-repos (see
  `docs/git-repos.md`).
- If you use `gh issue develop <n> --name <branch-name> --base develop` instead (to get
  GitHub's native issue-branch link), it checks the branch out in the current working tree
  by default - immediately switch that working tree back to its original branch, then
  `git worktree add <path> <branch-name>` (no `-b`, the branch already exists).

Report the worktree's absolute path clearly - the user needs it to `cd` there themselves.
You may then call `EnterWorktree` with `path: "<the path just created>"` to switch this
session into it, since that form of the tool accepts any existing worktree of the repo.

### 6. Push and open the PR

Per `docs/openspec.md`:

- Push the new branch: `git push -u origin <branch-name>` (run inside the worktree).
- `gh pr create --repo <owner/repo> --base develop --draft --title "<issue title, no Conventional Commits prefix>" --body "..."`
- Set PR assignee, labels, project, and milestone to match the issue.
- Link the PR to the issue (via a `Closes #<n>` line in the body, or `gh issue develop`'s
  auto-link if used in step 5).

### 7. Report back

Summarize: change name, repo, issue number/URL, worktree path, branch name, PR URL. Tell the
user the worktree is ready for `openspec-apply-change` to begin implementing tasks.

## Gotchas

- Never edit tracked source files in the main working tree for this work - the worktree
  created in step 5 is the only place code changes should happen.
- `gh issue list --search` needs `in:title,body` (not the default, which is title-only) or
  it will miss issues that only mention the change name in the description.
- Multiple repos in this project share the same OpenSpec `changes/` directory name pattern -
  always confirm which repo before creating the worktree, a wrong-repo worktree is wasted
  setup.
